DOCUMENTATION DRAFT: RunningCadence


Available in English and Chinese translations.

Android Development Tools (ADT) plugin must be downloaded to access the code and make enhancements.

ADT can be found at developer.android.com and can be used with any Java IDE.

Nine different classes are used to build the app and all are housed within the package leoliang.runningcadence.

Separate classes for the VoiceFeedback (creates voice guidance for the user), TextToSpeechOutput (creates audio from text), SettingActivity (controls buttons to set cadence and start the program for the user), RunningCadenceActivity (creates visual display of current cadence while program is running), Application (provides various system and app configurations), BackgroundService (provides methods to run the app such as start, run and showNotification), BeepPlayer (produces beep sound used in app), FootFallDetector (calculates number of foot strikes for cadence reading), & Preference Activity (sets user preferences such as text to speech language).

End of line braces are used to limit whitespace and braces even if not explicitly needed (aka, One True Brace Style).  All variables are private, new variables should follow suit.

Functionality: **additional info to be added after coding is complete.

The app has an adjustable counter where the user enters the desired number of steps to be targeted.  Voice prompts guide the user throughout the activity with current cadence and instructions on whether to speed up or slow down.  

The app has a log that will store the 50(??) most recent activities.  The data can be viewed as a graph to see performance over time.

The user is also able to link their results to Facebook in order to share the information with others.

A timer is included in the app to inform the user of the duration of their activity.

The app has a GPS mapping feature that tracks distance and provides a visual route to the user after the activity is completed.  


Code Sample to demonstrate style and structure of program:

**May change after new code is added

public class PreferenceActivity extends android.preference.PreferenceActivity implements OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener {

	private static final String LOG_TAG = "PreferenceActivity";
	private final int DIALOG_TTS_NOT_WORK = 1;
	private TextToSpeechOutput ttsOutput;

	@Override
	public void onSharedPreferenceChanged(SharedPreferences sharedPreferences, String key) {
		if (key.equals("pref_language")) {
			((Application) getApplication()).setLocale();
			restartActivity();
		}
	}

Installation:

The app is available for android devices through the Google Play store. There is no cost to download the app; the user will access their Google Play account and search for RunningCadence by Aelung and choose Install.

Source Files:

RunningCadence is written in the Java programming language.  The source code files (found on GitHub) are easily downloaded as a zip file.  The program can also be cloned to a programmerâ€™s local machine if enhancements are desired.
