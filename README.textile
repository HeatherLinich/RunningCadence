h2. What's it

For a runner, increasing cadence is an important skill that improves your
running form, improves running efficiency and reduces running injuries.

RunningCadence helps you achieve the target cadence in your running workout. 
It is an application running on Android device, detects your running cadence,
plays tone when you're running too slow or too fast then the target cadence.

Note: It isn't a walk pedometer. Cadence is counted only when you're running.
