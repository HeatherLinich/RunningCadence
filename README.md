Running Cadence
===============

What's it
---------

RunningCadence is an Android application for runners who want to achieve for fast and steady running cadence.

RunningCadence detects how many steps per minute and gives you real time voice feed back during your workout, guides you to keep running on your target cadence, not too slow nor too fast. So that you get the feeling of it, make yourself comfortable with it, and let your body remember the cadence. It's the best way you make progress, you can't make it by recording then review after you're sitting at home.

Device should have Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine and language data installed to play voice feedback.

_Note: It isn't a walk pedometer. Cadence is counted only when you're running._

How to use
----------

Bind the phone at your arm with arm band; listen to voice feed back by earphone. This app is able to run together with music player.

Contribute
----------

I'm not good at graph design, if you could help to improve the design of application UI or the user experience, I'll be very appreciated.

Also I'd like to have it translated into other languages.
